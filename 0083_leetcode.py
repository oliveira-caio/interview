"""83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/

problem: Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that
each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

### IMPORTANT: REMEMBER WHEN THERE ARE 3 OR MORE ELEMENTS WITH THE SAME VALUE.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        node = head
        while node:
            if node.next and node.val == node.next.val:
                node.next = node.next.next
            else:
                node = node.next
        return head
